# rover-challenge
This was a challenge exercise that was shared with me to create tests using xUnit which I hasn't done before, and I was having so much fun, I made a console app so I could get it to work. I time boxed the effort but used several different approaches within to the program in case anyone wanted to look at it and evaluate it.
